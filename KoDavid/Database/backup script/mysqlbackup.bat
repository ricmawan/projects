:: FEATURES --------------------------------------------------
:: - Backup all MySQl databases, including all newly created ones automatically
:: - Create an individual .sql file for each database (God send when restoring)
:: - ZIP all the .sql files into one zip file and date/timestamp the file name to save space
:: - Automatically delete MySQL backups older than n days (set to however many days you like)
:: - FTP your backup zip to a remote location
:: - Highly suggest you also setup a scheduled task to backup your MySQL directory and your new backup folder to an off site location

:: PRE REQUISITE ---------------------------------------------
:: - MySQL server installed
:: - 7zip installed

:: If the time is less than two digits insert a zero so there is no space to break the filename

:: If you have any regional date/time issues call this include: getdate.cmd  credit: Simon Sheppard for this cmd - untested
::call getdate.cmd
